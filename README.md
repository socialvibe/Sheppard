# Sheppard

## Reference app for Android TV and Fire TV TAR (TruexAdRenderer) integration

This is an Android TV and Fire TV application exposing direct calls into `TruexAdRenderer` instances, enabling functional testing as well as prototyping. 
The application is set up with a simple activity and the calls in the `MainActivity` should be self-explanatory.

The Truex ad will display once playback reaches the 3:29 mark, at manually at any time via the Menu key on the remote.
